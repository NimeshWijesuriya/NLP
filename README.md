# *Natural Language Processing*
- NLP, or Natural Language Processing, is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful.

## Key components of NLP include:
1. Zero-shot classification 
    - Zero-shot classification is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that allows you to classify text into predefined categories or labels without the need for any training examples or labeled data for those specific categories. Hugging Face is a popular platform for NLP, and it provides access to various pre-trained language models, including GPT-3, GPT-4, and others, which can be used for zero-shot classification.
    

```python

result = classifier(
    "This is a course about the Transformers library",
    candidate_labels=["education", "politics", "business"]
)
